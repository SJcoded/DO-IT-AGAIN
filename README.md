# Do it again

### The climb to heaven isn't a one-way trip! Each life's a random factor, but you've just gotta **do it again!**

### ***"DO IT AGAIN"*** is a platformer with just **one** level as the 'Heavenly Court's' trial. To combat the trial's obstacles, the player is gifted an ability by the Judge God, assigned randomly by dice roll! Feather falling, Anti-gravity, and more - Each new life brings promise of a helpful (not guaranteed) upgrade!
